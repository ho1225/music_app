          "standard": "Longtime Imagine Dragons fans will notice a newfound brightness on the Las Vegas bandâs third album. Thatâs because frontman Dan Reynolds wrote most of it after coming out of a serious depression that had plagued him since childhood but worsened after the bandâs first major tour to support its hugely successful 2012 debut album. Where 2015 follow-up <i>Smoke + Mirrors</i> had a heavier, darker bite, 2017's <i>Evolve</i> is noticeably lighter, buoyed by more heart, soul, and groove.\n\nSonically, this is the best-selling rock band of the 2010s going full-out pop. Sure, there are a few sizzles of power-ballad guitar tossed in for good measure, but <i>Evolve</i> is Imagine Dragons proving it can still galvanize the forces by dialing down on the thundering rock theatricsâjust a bit. Even the militaristic stomp of a song literally called âThunderâ is tempered by giddy, helium-pumped vocals.\n\nIn a sense, Imagine Dragonsâ evolution here is felt more in spirit than sound, and nothing says that more than the shuffling, gospel-tinged âNext To Me,â the bandâs first big love song. The track was such a significant emotional shiftâthat the outfit decided to add it to the top of the albumâs 2018 reissue. But itâs hardly the only glimmer of romance here. âI Donât Know Whyâ takes a page from The Weeknd and Daft Punkâs smash collaborations with its starry-eyed electro-pop grooviness and Reynoldsâ most sizzling confession yet: âYour love is always dangerous,â he sneers. On âIâll Make It Up To You,â he pledges his loyalty to his partner over sparkling soulful pop; later, he reveals more of that tender side on the woozy electro-R&B reverie âDancing In The Dark.â\n\nOf course, this wouldnât be an Imagine Dragons record without a sturdy collection of sky-high inspirational anthems, like fist-pumping sing-alongs âWhatever It Takesâ and âWalking The Wire.â But âBelieverâ is the big standout, a perfectly polished composite of the groupâs most reliable moves: pummeling rhythms, buzzing sub-bass, a shout-to-the-heavens chorus, and a no-pain-no-gain message. Unsurprisingly, it would score Imagine Dragons another massive hit.\n\n\n\n",

          "standard": "Four albums in six years is a breakneck pace for any major artist in 2018, to say nothing of a band as ascendant and ambitious as Imagine Dragons. And as with its predecessors, the songs that comprise <i>Origins</i>âcoming just over a year after the blockbuster <i>Evolve</i>âaren't tossed-off lo-fi recordings. Theyâre big hits with big beats and big choruses and big production, made for the big venues that the Los Angeles/Las Vegas quartet regularly play. And if the pressures that come with mounting pop stardom arenât enough to discourage a prolific streak, thereâs always debilitating personal strife. But those hard times led to more songs, frontman Dan Reynolds tells Apple Music.<br />\n<b>How did this album come together so quickly?</b>\nSome of these songs were written when we had weeks off on tour; some were written a month ago. I know thereâs some bands that say, âEvery three years weâll put out a record and feed the fans, do a big tour, and then go away,â but we have the ability to continually feed the culture and fan base of Imagine Dragons, so why not do that? I grew up mainly listening to hip-hop and I loved the whole aspect of mixtapesâyou could consume stuff from your favorite artists continually, and rock doesnât do that. We kind of just get put there because we have a guitarist and because sometimes I sing a little screamy, but I really am more influenced by the culture of hip-hop, and of R&B music. <br />\n<b>Is there one particular song that made you realize this was going to be a proper album sooner than later?</b>\nThe last track, âReal Life,â really solidified things for me. Imagine Dragons has never been a love song kind of band, but this record is, like, 90% about love and relationships. I went through a hard divorce this year and we announced it to the worldâthen we never wound up signing the papers. We have a chaotic relationship, but a stale one seems worse to me. It sounds like such a clichÃ©d thing to say, but going through heartbreak is devastating. Your whole world falls apart.<br />\n<b>So you threw yourself into writing?</b> I had to be either listening to or creating music at all times, because I was so afraid of facing a quiet room. I just had this gaping hole that felt so desolate and scary, and music at least took me away from that. âBad Liarâ I wrote with my wife right before we separated, and itâs all about a dying relationship. Listening to it now that weâre back together, itâs kind of cathartic in a weird way.<br />\n<b>Do you write differently now, knowing thereâs a huge audience waiting?</b>\nFortunately, we have a few things going for us. Weâve been pretty genre-less since the beginning, so whereas some bands get pigeonholed, weâre able to be all over the gamut. I love big melodies and poppy songs; the only rock I listened to was Rage Against the Machine and Minor Threat. I enjoy writing pop music and I want to write big pop songs.",

          "standard": "Las Vegas quartet Imagine Dragonsâ first major-label recording finds them working with English hip-hop producer and songwriter Alex da Kid. âRadioactiveâ opens their <i>Continued Silence</i> EP with an impressive arsenal of bells and whistles. Over a contemporary folk-rock foundation on par with the band Train, Alex da Kid layer a huge rumbling bass and equally gigantic beats. Itâs the grappling melody that stands out hereâespecially in the songâs chorus, where Dan Reynoldsâ vocal parts are overlapped to sound like heâs singing with himself. The following song, âDemonsâ, takes on darker characteristics that have more in common with Coldplay. It starts with Reynolds singing over delicate keyboard parts before the bombastic beats return alongside self-accompanying vocal tracks and subtly trippy electric guitar effects. âOn Top of the Worldâ tones down the rhythmic explosions for a skittering beat built on handclaps and finger snaps, over which Imagine Dragons play an uplifting tune infused with world-beat accoutrements. âMy Faultâ closes on a ballad where Reynolds sings self-scrutinizing lyrics."

          "standard": "While trekking through sold-out arenas around the world to support its 2012 smash debut, <i>Night Visions</i>, Imagine Dragons was already feverishly thinking about its next move. How could it not? The more singles it released, the bigger it seemed to get. And so, the Vegas band approached its 2015 sophomore album as another skyscraping mountain to climbâor better yet, move. <i>Smoke + Mirrors</i> embraces all the bandâs melting-pot whims while leaning more heavily into its rock ambitions. If possible, the songs here thrash and thunder with even more might than those of its predecessor, perhaps a symptom of the daunting weight of Imagine Dragonsâ success.\nAs on <i>Night Visions</i>, frontman Dan Reynolds thrives in emotional extremes, but here heâs more pointed in his words, and his targetâhimself. âIâm sorry for everything, oh, everything Iâve done,â he cries at the top of opener âShots,â a shimmery synth-pop romp that still manages to triumphantly gallop into the sunset. On âGold,â he frets over the impact of his bandâs Midas touch: âWho can you trust when everything you touch turns to gold?â he roars over a Zeus-worthy stomp. Meanwhile, on âDream,â he slips into a Coldplay-like mood, falsetto and all, determined to keep dreaming because âeverythingâs a mess.â\nThe rest of the band is just as eager to push beyond respective limits. Guitarist Wayne Sermon muscles up with the bluesy, Black Keys-esque riffs that pummel through the reverb-laden âIâm So Sorry.â He flexes even harder on the folky battle cry âI Bet My Life,â another anthem that vies for world domination. Throughout, bassist/keyboardist Ben McKee and drummer Daniel Platzman are feverishly sculpting the mood, most menacingly on the sitar-meets-metal bruiser âFrictionâ and most playfully on the polyrhythmic uplifter âSummer.â\nMuch of <i>Smoke + Mirrors</i> was written on the road, with an aim for even bigger arenas to conquer. While nothing here quite matched the Herculean triumph of 2012âs âRadioactive,â the more vulnerable moments and sonic experiments would set the tone for the bandâs next evolution.",

          "standard": "âI never fully comprehend, thematically, what the record is about,â Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds tells Apple Music about their fifth full-length album. âIâm not that deliberate, for better or worse, when Iâm writing.â After three years and some band therapy, <i>Mercury - Act 1</i> arrives as ascending, eclectic, accessible arena rock, amplified by a new collaborator: legendary producer Rick Rubin (Beastie Boys, Johnny Cash, System of a Down, Tom Petty, AC/DC, Red Hot Chili Peppers). âThey're wildly sophisticated in their production ability, in their playing, and in their writing, this glut of greatness,â Rubin says of the band.<br />\nRubinâs style allowed Reynolds to rectify his loss of religious faith and discover a new kind of meaning on record. âMy first goal with creating art is putting out something that is honest,â Reynolds says. âOne of the things that has been so inspiring to me working with Rick is I have been trying to refine spirituality and belief. When the rug is pulled out on you with religion, I was left with nothing. It made me trust no one. Any story anybody told me, it was a ghost story. I've been trying to refine believing in deeper things, unexplainable things. I'm trusting where I feel honesty. Rick is honest.â<br />\n<i>Mercury - Act 1</i> became a record about letting goâabout moving forward (like in the haunting vocal overlays of âWrecked,â a song written about Reynoldsâ sister-in-law who died of cancer in 2019)âand about accepting what terrifies us. âMy biggest fear in life, and I didn't know this until recently, is lack of control,â Reynolds admits, revealing that he confronted that fear in a spiritually transformative ayahuasca trip, which no doubt influenced the record. âI had to give up control completely. And I died. Spiritually, I felt like I died. I saw so many things in my life from a bird's-eye view. Then I heard like the bell and this incredible shaman came over and was helping me come alive again. It felt like a rebirth. It was everything I was told religion would give to me.â<br />\nIf <i>Mercury - Act 1</i> sounds darker than its predecessor, 2018âs <i>Origins</i>, itâs because Imagine Dragons have never been so forthright; Rubin brought it out of the band. The ebullient percussion of âItâs Ok,â the shimmery piano of âEasy Come Easy Go,â the thunderous nu-metal-adjacent âCutthroat,â the glitchy romance of âMondayââall of these kaleidoscopic elements work to mirror Reynoldsâ understanding that some things are out of our control, and thatâs all right. âI'd be overly metaphorical out of fear of people knowing what I was talking about,â Reynolds says. âI have a hard enough time knowing that people are going to hear what I'm talking about.â",

          "standard": "âOne thing we saw very early on in the recording process was the fact that this couldnât be one record,â Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds tells Apple Music. âThere were two different directions, two stories being told, and two timelines. We had songs that I wrote right after my best friend took his life and right after my sister passed awayâyou know, grieving songs. And then we had songs that were written, because of COVID, almost three years later, when I was in a totally different place. I had a different story to tell.â The band decided to release two variations on a single theme: <i>Mercury - Act 1</i> addresses the death and grieving process, while <i>Act 2</i> unpacks the complicated task of trying to move forward.\n\nThese eclectic and ultimately uplifting rock songs are amplified by the bandâs new collaborator: legendary producer Rick Rubin (Beastie Boys, Johnny Cash, System of a Down, Tom Petty, AC/DC, Red Hot Chili Peppers). âTheyâre wildly sophisticated in their production ability, in their playing, and in their writingâthis glut of greatness,â Rubin says of the band. Rubinâs style allowed Reynolds to rectify his loss of religious faith and discover a new kind of meaning on the record. âMy first goal with creating art is putting out something that is honest,â Reynolds says. âOne of the things that has been so inspiring to me working with Rick is I have been trying to refine spirituality and belief.

Iâve been trying to refine believing in deeper things, unexplainable things. Iâm trusting where I feel honesty.

Then I heard, like, the bell and this incredible shaman came over and was helping me come alive again. It felt like a rebirth. It was everything I was told religion would give to me.â <i>Act 2</i> focuses on the âpost-deathâ experience, he says, and reaches for the light at the end of the tunnel. âDealing with someone who has passedâand then what? What does tomorrow look like? Grief is always there, but life continues. Itâs about being present. All you have, after you lose someone close to you, is this [new perspective] that every single second counts.â",

          "standard": "âThis is it, the apocalypse,â Imagine Dragonsâ frontman Dan Reynolds boldly declares on âRadioactive,â the thunderous opening track of the Las Vegas quartetâs monstrous 2012 debut album. âWelcome to the new age,â he continues with an ominous snarl, as if challenging anyone to suggest otherwise. The track pushes on like a gladiator's call to arms, punctuated with earth-shattering bass. Itâs an all-or-nothing stadium rouser that introduces Imagine Dragons as a band ready to take on the worldâand boy, would it. \nâRadioactiveâ has since been certified Diamond and become one of the best-selling singles of all time. Not bad for a band that was closing out the 2000s playing the local casino scene just to make rent. <i>Night Visions</i> is a clear marker of its time, an uncompromising amalgam of early 21st-century alt-rockâthink The Killersâ soaring sincerity mixed with Museâs formidable swagger and Mumford & Sonsâ folky zealâinfused with boisterous elements of hip-hop and dubstep. The band seems on a mission to outdo itself with every track. The top half of the albumâheavy in hitsâsets out to prove this. âItâs Timeâ is a vivid anthem for picking oneself up, buoyed by guitarist Wayne Sermonâs plunky mandolin, while âOn Top of the Worldâ adds a touch of Jack Johnson-like levity to a clap-happy Steve Reich sample. But itâs not all so optimistic. âDemonsâ slips back into the darkness, plodding up a bass-laden hill in search of peak catharsis. \nThat intensity never lets up through the second half. Reynolds counts his sins over the jagged rhythms of âBleeding Outâ and reflects on the bandâs humble beginnings on the squelchy, synth-edged banger âUnderdog.â The members finally let themselves stretch out on the sprawling rock-operatic closer âNothing Left To Say / Rocks (Medley),â which ends on a merry, mandolin-fueled note and one pivotal question from Reynolds: âWhere do we go from here?â\nThis 10-year-anniversary Super Deluxe Edition from 2022 reveals where Imagine Dragons startedâmany of the bonus studio recordings can be found on earlier EPs, like the midtempo meditation âThe Riverââand where they began to hit their stride. A buoyant 2014 performance from Red Rocks shows how well the band translates the ferocity of the record to the stage, while the final collection of remixes highlight its wide-range appeal.",
